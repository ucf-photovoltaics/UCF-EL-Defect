This is a script meant for easy use of our defect segmentation model. Our models are trained and evaluated using the PyTorch python package. 

This code requires the following python packages:
- copy
- matplotlib
- numpy
- os
- torch
- torchvision
- PIL

TO USE:
1. Place model path in the models folder and the images in the Test_Images directory.
2. Rename all the paths and folder names appropriately at the top of test_images.py (if necessary).
3. Run test_images.py. To save the output, uncomment line #74.
